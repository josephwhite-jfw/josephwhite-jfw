# 💫 About Me:
I'm an undergraduate Economics and Mathematics student at Miami University, with a strong interest in the industrial organization of healthcare markets. My current research focuses on how dominant healthcare providers influence competitors through competitive spillovers. Long-term, I plan to pursue an MA in Economics and continue to do research in my professional career..<br><br>
