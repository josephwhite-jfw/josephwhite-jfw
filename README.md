# Joe White 
Economics and Mathematics Student at Miami University (OH) 

I am an undergraduate Economics and Mathematics student at Miami University, with a strong interest in the industrial organization of healthcare markets and algorithmic pricing. My current research focuses on how dominant healthcare providers influence competitors through competitive spillovers. At Miami, my coursework includes applied econometrics, optimization, advanced linear algebra, and financial economics using R. I am to increase my skills that will support my empirical and computational research. Long-term, I plan to pursue an MA in Economics and continue to do research in my professional career..<br><br>
